# üìò Guidebook: Solving "Longest Repeating Character Replacement" Using Sliding Window & Two-Pointer Approach

---

## üìå Problem Statement

You are given:

* A string `s` consisting of **uppercase English letters**.
* An integer `k`.

**Goal**: Find the **length of the longest substring** that can be formed where all characters are the **same**, after replacing **at most `k` characters** in the substring with any other uppercase letter.

---

## üîç Example

### Input:

```plaintext
s = "AABABBA"
k = 1
```

### Output:

```plaintext
4
```

### Explanation:

* Replace the second 'B' with 'A' ‚Üí "AABAABA" ‚Üí substring "AABA" ‚Üí 3 'A's and 1 replaced.
* Longest such possible substring = 4.

---

## üöÄ Brute Force Approach

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Generate all substrings** of `s`.
2. For each substring, count the **frequency of characters**.
3. Determine **how many characters need to be changed** to make the substring all the same.
4. If changes ‚â§ `k`, update the answer with this substring's length.

### Key Insight:

To make all characters the same:

```plaintext
Changes needed = (Length of substring) - (Max frequency of any character in the substring)
```

---

### üî¢ Brute Force Pseudocode:

```python
max_len = 0
for i in range(len(s)):
    freq = [0]*26
    max_freq = 0
    for j in range(i, len(s)):
        freq[ord(s[j]) - ord('A')] += 1
        max_freq = max(max_freq, freq[ord(s[j]) - ord('A')])
        if (j - i + 1) - max_freq <= k:
            max_len = max(max_len, j - i + 1)
```

### Time Complexity:

* O(N¬≤) due to the nested loops.
* Space: O(26) = O(1) constant, as only 26 characters are tracked.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Optimized Approach: Sliding Window + Two Pointers

### Core Idea:

Use a **sliding window** (`left`, `right` pointers):

* Expand the window from the right.
* Keep track of character frequencies within the window.
* If the window becomes invalid (more than `k` changes needed), **shrink from the left**.

### ‚úÖ Valid Window Condition:

```plaintext
Window length - Max frequency of a character in the window ‚â§ k
```

---

### ‚ö° Optimized Algorithm Steps

1. Initialize:

   * `left = 0`, `max_len = 0`, `max_freq = 0`
   * Frequency array `freq = [0]*26`

2. Loop through the string using `right`:

   * Update frequency of `s[right]`
   * Update `max_freq` if needed
   * If the window is **invalid**, move `left` pointer forward
   * Update `max_len`

---

### üí° Optimization Note:

Even if the `max_freq` is outdated after shrinking the window, we **don‚Äôt recalculate** it because:

* We‚Äôre only interested in finding longer valid substrings.
* A reduced `max_freq` won‚Äôt help achieve a longer substring.

---

### ‚úÖ Final Optimized Code (Python):

```python
def characterReplacement(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    freq = [0] * 26
    left = 0
    max_freq = 0
    max_len = 0

    for right in range(len(s)):
        idx = ord(s[right]) - ord('A')
        freq[idx] += 1
        max_freq = max(max_freq, freq[idx])

        # Check if window is valid
        if (right - left + 1) - max_freq > k:
            freq[ord(s[left]) - ord('A')] -= 1
            left += 1

        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)

    return max_len
```
