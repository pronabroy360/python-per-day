Absolutely! Let’s walk through **everything** you need to fully understand this problem — from intuition, to algorithm design, to dry run — all clearly and step by step.

## 🧠 **Problem: Nth Magic Number**

A **magic number** is defined as a number formed by summing **unique powers of 5**, where the powers used depend on the binary representation of `N`.

### 👉 For example:

Let `N = 5`
Binary of 5 = `101`
So the bits are:

```
Position (right to left):   2   1   0
Bits:                       1   0   1
```

Take:

* bit at position 0 → 1 → include `5^1 = 5`
* bit at position 1 → 0 → skip
* bit at position 2 → 1 → include `5^3 = 125`

So,

```
Magic Number = 5 + 125 = 130
```

---

## ✨ **Intuition**

Each bit in the binary representation of `N` tells us **whether to include a certain power of 5**:

| Binary Bit | Power Used | Included? |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------- |
| `b₀`       | `5^1`      | If 1      |
| `b₁`       | `5^2`      | If 1      |
| `b₂`       | `5^3`      | If 1      |
| ...        | ...        | ...       |

So we:

1. Look at each bit in `N`
2. For each `1` bit at position `i`, we include `5^(i+1)` in the total
3. Sum these powers → that’s the Nth magic number

## 🧩 **Algorithm (with Bitwise Operations)**

```python
def magicNumber(n, base):
    result = 0 
    while n > 0:
        if n & 1:
            result += base 
        base *= 5
        n >>= 1 
    return result
```

### 🔄 Explanation of each step:

* `n & 1`: Checks if the **last bit of n** is 1.
* `result += base`: If it is, add the current power of 5.
* `base *= 5`: Go to the next power of 5.
* `n >>= 1`: Right shift `n` (drop the bit we just checked).

---

## 🧪 **Dry Run Example**

Let’s dry run `magicNumber(5, 5)`

* Input:

  * `n = 5` → binary = `101`
  * `base = 5`

---

### Initial values:

```
n = 5
base = 5
result = 0
```

---

### Loop 1:

```
n = 5 → binary: 101 → last bit is 1 (n & 1 == 1)
→ result += base = 0 + 5 = 5
→ base *= 5 = 25
→ n >>= 1 = 2
```

---

### Loop 2:

```
n = 2 → binary: 10 → last bit is 0
→ result unchanged
→ base *= 5 = 125
→ n >>= 1 = 1
```

---

### Loop 3:

```
n = 1 → binary: 1 → last bit is 1
→ result += base = 5 + 125 = 130
→ base *= 5 = 625
→ n >>= 1 = 0 → loop ends
```

---

### ✅ Final Output:

```
result = 130
```

So the **5th magic number** is **130**.

---

## ⛏️ Why Use `base *= 5`?

We start `base = 5`, and then each loop multiplies by 5 again:

* 5 → 25 → 125 → 625 → ...

So:

* First bit (LSB) contributes `5^1 = 5`
* Second bit contributes `5^2 = 25`
* Third bit contributes `5^3 = 125`
* and so on...

---

## ⏱️ Time Complexity

* Each iteration processes one bit of `n`
* Number of bits in `n` = `log₂(n)` (at most)

So:
**Time Complexity** = `O(log₂(n))`
**Space Complexity** = `O(1)`

---

## ✅ Final Notes

* This solution uses **bitwise operations**, which are very efficient
* It's much faster than converting to strings (`bin(n)`), and uses less memory
* It's flexible: you can change the `base` from 5 to anything (like 3, 7, etc.) to generate other types of "magic numbers"

## 🔁 Bonus: First Few Magic Numbers

Let’s generate first few for `n = 1 to 5`:

| N | Binary | Magic Number  |
| - | ------ | ------------- |
| 1 | 001    | 5             |
| 2 | 010    | 25            |
| 3 | 011    | 5 + 25 = 30   |
| 4 | 100    | 125           |
| 5 | 101    | 5 + 125 = 130 |

Let me know if you'd like to modify it to generate the first `k` magic numbers, or build a version using recursion or `for` loop!
