Sure! Below is a **very detailed step-by-step guideline** based on the transcript for solving the **“Fruit Into Baskets”** problem using **two approaches**:

## 🍎 Problem Summary: "Fruit Into Baskets"

You are given an array representing fruit types on trees in a row. You have **two baskets**, each of which can hold **only one type of fruit**. You must pick fruit starting from any tree and move only **right**—you **cannot skip** trees. Your goal is to **collect the most fruits** possible using **two baskets**.

---

## 🧠 Problem Interpretation:

Transform this into a classic **sliding window** problem:

* **Objective**: Find the **longest subarray** (continuous) that contains **at most 2 unique elements**.
* **Why?** Because each basket can only hold one fruit type, and you can carry two baskets → max 2 types.

---

## 👨‍💻 Brute Force Approach

### ✅ Idea:

* Try **every subarray** starting from each index and check if it contains at most 2 types.
* Use a **Set** to keep track of unique fruit types.

### 🧾 Steps:

1. Loop `i` from 0 to `n - 1` (start of subarray).
2. Initialize an empty `Set`.
3. Loop `j` from `i` to `n - 1` (end of subarray).
4. Insert `arr[j]` into the set.
5. If the set has ≤ 2 elements:

   * Update max length as `max(maxLen, j - i + 1)`
6. Else:

   * Break inner loop.

### 🕓 Time Complexity:

* `O(n²)` because of nested loops.

### 🧠 Space Complexity:

* `O(1)` — set size ≤ 3

## ⚡ Optimized Approach – Sliding Window (Two Pointers)

### ✅ Idea:

Use **left (`L`)** and **right (`R`)** pointers to maintain a valid window with **at most 2 unique fruit types**.

### 🧾 Steps:

1. Initialize:

   * `L = 0`, `R = 0`, `maxLen = 0`
   * A **map** (dictionary) `fruitFreq` to store `fruit: frequency`
2. Loop while `R < n`:

   * Add `arr[R]` to the map (increase frequency).
   * If `map.size > 2`, it's invalid:

     * Shrink from the left:

       * Decrease `fruitFreq[arr[L]]`
       * If frequency becomes 0 → delete it
       * Move `L` right
   * If valid (map size ≤ 2):

     * Update `maxLen = max(maxLen, R - L + 1)`
   * Move `R` right.

### ⏱ Time Complexity:

* `O(n)` – each pointer (`L`, `R`) moves at most `n` times.

### 🧠 Space Complexity:

* `O(1)` – map stores at most 2 or 3 fruit types.

## 🧠 Further Optimized Approach – Avoiding While Loops (True O(n))

### ✅ Idea:

* Instead of a while loop to trim the window when invalid, just **remove one fruit at a time**.
* Prevent unnecessary back-to-back deletions.

### 🧾 Steps:

1. Same map-based frequency tracker.
2. After adding `arr[R]`, check if the map size > 2:

   * If yes, remove 1 occurrence of `arr[L]`
   * If frequency becomes 0 → remove key
   * Move `L` ahead by one
3. Update `maxLen = max(maxLen, R - L + 1)`
4. Move `R` forward.

### ✅ Benefit:

* This removes nested movement and ensures each element is processed only once → **strict `O(n)`**

## ✨ Pseudocode for Optimized Approach

```python
def totalFruit(arr):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    fruitFreq = defaultdict(int)
    L = 0
    maxLen = 0
    
    for R in range(len(arr)):
        fruitFreq[arr[R]] += 1

        while len(fruitFreq) > 2:
            fruitFreq[arr[L]] -= 1
            if fruitFreq[arr[L]] == 0:
                del fruitFreq[arr[L]]
            L += 1

        maxLen = max(maxLen, R - L + 1)
    
    return maxLen
```

## 🧪 Example Walkthrough

**Input:** `[3,3,3,1,2,1,1,2,3,3,4]`
**Step-by-step window movement:**

* Build up valid windows of 2 fruit types.
* Track longest one (`[1,2,1,1,2]` → length = 5).
* Each time a third fruit is added → shrink window until valid.

---

## 📚 Key Takeaways

* Transform the problem to **max length subarray with at most 2 distinct values**.
* Use a **sliding window** + **frequency map** to efficiently track and adjust.
* Avoid unnecessary iteration using **greedy trimming** of invalid windows.

## ✅ Final Time & Space Complexities

| Approach            | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Brute Force         | O(n²)           | O(1)             |
| Optimized (Sliding) | O(n)            | O(1)             |

## 📌 Interview Tips

* Explain your **initial brute force** clearly.
* Describe **why it’s inefficient**, and how **sliding window** improves it.
* Justify the **space optimization** (bounded map size).
* Use a **small example** during explanation.
